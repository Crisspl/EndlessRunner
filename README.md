# EndlessRunner

EndlessRunner is a simple game created in [FHL](https://github.com/Crisspl/FHL) graphics library.  
Before running an executable make sure to [download Resources](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jxlkq55uhnx3wd5/AADM-S7WDHZJhNqYdW7ChOHta?dl=0) and place them (in folder named 'Resources') next to the executable.  
Also sorry for lack of any `FindFHL.cmake`. It will be done ASAP.
